# Gaming Hub Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
Gaming Hub is a web platform designed for gaming enthusiasts to explore, purchase, and interact with games. Users can register, buy games, add new games, comment on existing games, and view other users' profiles.

## 2. Key Features
- User Registration and Authentication
- Game Purchase and Addition
- Game Commenting
- User Profile Management

## 3. Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express

## 4. Architecture Overview
The project follows a client-server architecture. The client is built using ReactJS, and the server is implemented using Express. Data is stored in MongoDB.

## 5. Components/Modules
- **Details Component:** Displays game details including description, contributor information, and release date.
- **Comments Component:** Allows users to view and add comments for a specific game.
- **Profile Component:** Manages user profiles, including name, description, profile picture, and a list of added games.

## 6. Data Storage
Data is stored in MongoDB, utilizing three collections:
